# Decentralized Autonomous Energy Grid (DAEG)

## Overview

DAEG is an innovative blockchain-powered platform that revolutionizes energy distribution by enabling peer-to-peer energy trading within local microgrids. By leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts, and real-time market dynamics, our solution empowers communities to create a more efficient, sustainable, and democratized energy ecosystem.

## Key Features

### 1. Decentralized Energy Marketplace
- Enables direct energy trading between prosumers (producers and consumers)
- Eliminates traditional centralized energy distribution barriers
- Provides transparent and fair pricing mechanisms

### 2. Energy Tokenization
- Each kilowatt-hour (kWh) is represented as a unique, tradable token
- Transparent tracking of energy production and consumption
- Enables granular energy credit and compensation systems

### 3. Smart Contract Automation
- Automated energy trading and settlement processes
- Real-time contract execution based on predefined rules
- Instant, secure, and transparent financial transactions

### 4. Dynamic Pricing Mechanism
- Pricing dynamically adjusted based on:
    - Real-time supply and demand
    - Renewable energy generation
    - Local grid conditions
- Incentivizes energy efficiency and renewable production

### 5. Smart Meter Integration
- Seamless connection with IoT-enabled smart meters
- Precise energy measurement and verification
- Automated data collection and transaction processing

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum/Polygon
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **IoT Integration**: MQTT, WebSocket
